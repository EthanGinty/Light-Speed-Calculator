Light Speed Calculator by Ethan Ginty

The purpose of this project was to practice my coding skills on my own to create a usable web app that showcases my knowledge of full stack 
web development.

SET-UP: 
  All you need to do to use this application is to first import the package into eclipse. Then, use terminal to cd into the database folder and 
  run create-myproject2-db.sh. After this everything should work as intended when you run the app in eclipse.

HOW TO PLAY:
  Click on the button of which ships you want to race against each other and then select the destination from the drop down selector at the top.
   Once you click "Engage" you will be taken to the results page and will see a table ranking each ship from fastest to slowest
    and the amount of time it took for them to reach the destination.
